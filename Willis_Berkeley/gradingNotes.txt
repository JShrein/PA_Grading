PART 1:
Total: -0

Good! Program works correctly

PART 2:
Total: -12

-2 Line 30: use 'move' or 'add' to shift between registers.  la works but its a roundabout way of doing it because your $s0 is not an address, its just a simple value.

-8 Instructions require that you store (-4) arithmetic results to memory and retrieve (-4) them from memory for printing

-2 As you say, your multiplication is not yet complete.  Half credit for half a multiplication operation.  (Consider just using 'mul' instead)

PART 3:
Total: -8

-6 Instructions require that you store your partial sum in memory and load it again during each iteration.

-2 Line 10: Use 'move' or 'add' instead

Works well, simple and efficient
