PART 1:
Total: -5

Prompt is misleading, size of array is fixed.

-5 Accepting input greater than declared array size is dangerous because your writing to memory thats out of bounds.

PART 2:
Total: -14

-8 Instructions require that you store your results to memory (not registers) and retrieve them from memory in order to print.

-4 Instructions require a concluding message

-2 could use some more comments

PART 3:
Total: -8

-6 Must store partial sum in memory each iteration and retrieve it for printing

-2 Almost no comments

Otherwise, program is good...very simple and efficient.
