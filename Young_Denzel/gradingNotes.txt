PART 1:
Total: -5

-5 Accepts input greater than 9.  This allows storing numbers beyond the bounds of the array.

PART 2:
Total: -22

Make sure you add plenty of comments

-8 Instructions require that you store (-4) arithmetic results to memory and retrieve (-4) them from memory for printing

-10 Lines 38, 39: The purpose is to prompt the user for input and use those as operands.  There is no variation to this program so its usefulness is extremely limited.

-4 No concluding message.

PART 3:
Total: -8

Could use more comments.

-6 Instructions require that you store your partial sum in memory and load it again during each iteration.

-2 Line 31: Use 'move' or 'add', using la to move values between registers is not proper.

Practicing loops is the perfect way to get over your discomfort in using loops.  Explicitly summing each value works....but its definitely inefficient.  Perfect job for a loop.  However, you're not *required* to use a loop, so no points lost.
