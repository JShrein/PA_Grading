Nice Work!
Program works well for all test cases.

PART 2:
Total: -6

-2 Instructions require to print intro including name

-4 Instructions ask for concluding message

use:
	li $v0, 10
	syscall
to exit gracefully

PART 3:
Total: -2

Line 18 is generally unsafe, use:
	addi $s0, $zero, 1
to ensure you know exactly what's in $s0

-2 Incorrect output, sum of odds in range 1-15 is 64.  You're off by one in your loop.

same as part 2, use graceful exit to get rid of the "dropped off bottom" message.
