PART 1:
Total: -7

-5 Because your input loop keeps adding $s5 to itself, if the user enters a negative number, then a valid number, line 36 add them together and you get less than you wanted to print.

-2 Should print from 1 to 9, but your line 37 allows user to input 0 and still get valid output.

PART 2:
Total: -2

-2 Lines 30 and 37 are inherently dangerous
If you want to move from $v0 to $s0 or $s1, consider using:
	add $s0, $zero, $v0
instead of:
	add $s0, $s0, $v0
It works in this case, but if this code were part of a loop or a larger program it would break because you would be adding whatever happened to be in that register at the time.

Loading all memory addresses into registers in the beginning is a bit inefficient because you can simply load them into the same register whenever you're ready to use them. OK though, no points lost.

All program parts function correctly

Nice Work!
Simple, direct, and efficient
