-2 Valiant effort in attempting to implement multiplication, and it works well for non-negative input, but crashes for negative input (negative B operand fails, negative A operand works) (Half credit for half a multiplication operation).  Among those who attempted this method, so far your's is the closest to being correct.  However, I recommend using the 'mul' opcode.
