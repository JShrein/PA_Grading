-5 Accepting input greater than declared array size is dangerous because your writing to memory thats outside the bounds of the array.

Line 36: I see what you're trying to do, and it *would* work, except that when you're testing against $s5, you're actually testing against the value of the memory location that $s5 holds, which is something like 268501068 (may be different for you, but should still be a large number).  As far as that branch instruction is concerned, it doesn't care if that value is an address (which is just a number like any other number) or a regular value, so your test ALWAYS evaluates to false, and so input it never limited.


PART 2:
Total: -8

-4 Program requires that you print an introduction including your name, program's title, and program's purpose
-4 Instructions require that you print a concluding message.

You'r program comment asks how to properly load and store values into memory but it looks like you figured it out.

Good Job! Program works as it should and all instructions were followed.
You could improve efficiency if you chose to but it works well.
