PART 2:
Total: -13

-8 Instructions require that you store your arithmetic results into memory, and retrieve them for printing.
-4 Instructions require a concluding message
-1 Comments are a bit limited

PART 3:
Total: -11

-5 Lines 8-19: '#' by itself is not a sufficient comment

Make sure to read the instructions thoroughly
