Please don't put everything together into 1 file.  I have to run these to evaluate them.  Normally, if it doesn't compile I'll mark it 0 and move on, but I'll separate the code for you this time.  

PART 1:
Total: -5

-5 Accepts input greater than 9.  This allows storing numbers beyond the bounds of the array.

PART 2:
Total: -0

Very Nice!
Great style and organization
Followed all directions

PART 3:
Total: -13

-5 Line 14: why testing against 11 instead of 15?
-6 Instructions require to store and retrieve partial sum value from memory each iteration. 
-2 Line 23: You have not called a function, so no need to return to $ra ($ra is 0 here so this results in a crash)
