Nice Work!

Line 29: Your prompt is off by 1 (asks for input in range 1 - 9 but accepts 0), but no pts. lost.
Line 39: In other instances, may not be a good idea to write over size since it is tied to the max capacity of the array.

PART 2:
Total: -8

-8 Instructions require that your arithmetic results be stored in memory and retrieved from memory for printing.

Code style and organization is very good.
Plenty of comments

PART 3:
Total: -6

-6 The instructions require the partial sum to be stored and retrieved from memory each iteration.

Again, good style and organization.
Program is simple and efficient.
