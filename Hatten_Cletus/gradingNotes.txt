PART 1:
Total: -3

-1 No need to move $t0 to $s0 through $a0, its position in either $t0 or $s0 is ok, but no need for all the moving.

Works correctly for correct input.
Prints 1 number for input < 1. OK
-2 Prints nothing for input greater than 9.  Would be more appropriate to use a branch to prompt for input again or to simply force printing of 9 numbers only.

PART 2:
Total: -10

-8 Fails to store arithmetic results in memory and retrieve them for printing.

Otherwise, code is very good.  Logic is simple, direct, and efficient.  Commenting is sufficient.

-2 Notice that your multiplication always prints 0.  This is because you are printing from $t3 instead of $t2, which is where the result of your 'mul' operation is stored.

PART 3:
Total: -30

Does not compile.
Come see me.  I see a lot of issues here regarding memory usage that we should clear up.

Must always make sure that a program compiles because failure to compile = automatic 0 points for problem.  If it compiles you will earn at least some credit.
